    For the purposes of our course, perform the following commands while logged in to Grace.
</Card>

1. Navigate to your home directory
   ```shell
   $ cd
   ```
1. Clone the course repository
   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/CNCLgithub/Algorithms-of-the-Mind.git
   ```
1. Enter your local copy of the course repository
   ```shell
   $ cd Algorithms-of-the-Mind
   ```

**To sync your local copy with the course repository, use the following commands in the `Algorithms-of-the-Mind` directory:**
1. **Stash your local changes**. This will save local modifications to a temporary area that we can restore from.
   ```shell
   $ git stash
   ```
1. **Fetch changes from `origin`**. Fetches the latest changes from the main course repository.
   ```shell
   $ git fetch origin
   ```
1. **Merge the updated repository with your local copy**.
   ```shell
   $ git merge origin/main
   ```
1. **Apply your stashed changes.** You can now apply your stashed changes back to your local copy because we've updated
   ```shell
   $ git stash pop
   ```
